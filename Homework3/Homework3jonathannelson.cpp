/*Count from 1 to 100 in increments of 1.
Count from 100 down to 1 in decrements of 1.
Count from 7 to 77 in steps of 7.
Count from 20 down to 2 in steps of -2.
Iterate over the sequence 2, 5, 8, 11, 14 , 17 , 20.
Iterate over the sequence 99, 88, 77, 66 , 55 , 44 , 33 , 22 , 11, 0. Hint use int rather than unsigned int here because the condition does not become false until iâ€™s value is -11, so the control variable must be able to represent both positive and negative values.*/
